# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: One-Time Setup Required

Your code has been pushed to GitHub, but you need to enable GitHub Pages to make the website live.

## Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

1. **Go to your repository**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/Mianhassam96/MultiMian-Studio

2. **Open Settings**:
   - Click the **Settings** tab at the top of the repository

3. **Navigate to Pages**:
   - In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **Pages**

4. **Configure Source**:
   - Under **Build and deployment**
   - Under **Source**, select: **GitHub Actions**
   - (NOT "Deploy from a branch")

5. **Save and Wait**:
   - The settings save automatically
   - Go to the **Actions** tab to see the deployment progress
   - First deployment takes 5-10 minutes

## After Setup:

Your website will be live at:
**https://mianhassam96.github.io/MultiMian-Studio/**

## Verify Deployment:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow running called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)
4. Visit your live website URL

## Future Updates:

Once set up, every push to `main` branch will automatically deploy your website!
