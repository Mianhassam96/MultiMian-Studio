WORDPRESS THEME - MANUAL CSS FIX
========================================

Since the automatic CSS loading isn't working, here's how to add the CSS manually in WordPress:

========================================
STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
========================================

1. GO TO WORDPRESS ADMIN:
   - Appearance → Theme File Editor
   - Select "MultiMian Pro" or "MultiMian Studio"
   - Click on "style.css" in the right sidebar

2. SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM of style.css

3. COPY ALL THE CSS from the file:
   wordpress-theme/assets/css/main.css
   
4. PASTE IT at the bottom of style.css in WordPress

5. CLICK "Update File"

6. CLEAR CACHE:
   - Clear WordPress cache
   - Press Ctrl + Shift + R in browser

7. REFRESH YOUR SITE

========================================
ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
========================================

If that doesn't work, the issue might be that WordPress is using a different theme or there's a caching issue.

Try this:
1. In WordPress Admin, go to: Appearance → Customize
2. Click "Additional CSS"
3. Paste ALL the CSS from wordpress-theme/assets/css/main.css
4. Click "Publish"

This will add the CSS directly through the WordPress Customizer.

========================================
QUICK FIX - ADD THIS TO HEADER:
========================================

Or add this to your header.php file right before </head>:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/css/main.css?v=<?php echo time(); ?>">

This forces WordPress to load the CSS file with cache busting.

========================================

The CSS file is located at:
wordpress-theme/assets/css/main.css

It contains all the styling for:
- Hero section
- Services section  
- Features section
- CTA section
- Footer
- Animations
- Responsive design

========================================
