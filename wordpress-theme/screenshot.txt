SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

To complete the theme, you need to add a screenshot.png file (1200x900px).

This screenshot will appear in the WordPress theme selector.

How to create it:
1. Open your website homepage in a browser
2. Take a screenshot of the full page
3. Crop/resize to 1200x900 pixels
4. Save as "screenshot.png"
5. Place in the theme root folder (same location as style.css)

Recommended tools:
- Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
- Online tools like Canva

The screenshot should show:
- Your hero section
- Navigation
- Part of the services section
- Overall design aesthetic

This file (screenshot.txt) can be deleted after you add screenshot.png.
